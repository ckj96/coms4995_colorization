# coms4995_Deep Learning_Colorization Project

Our project focuses on automatic colorization for gray images. 

We have experimented two methods: example-based method and fully end-to-end method. 

For the example-based method, we aim to create a network that gives reference on any gray image and perform automatic colorization based on the reference. 

For the end-to-end method, the goal is to achieve fully automatic colorization on gray image of any resolution, without any pre-processing or post-processing requirement.
