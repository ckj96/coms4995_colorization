# coms4995_Deep Learning_Colorization Project

Our project focuses on automatic colorization for gray images. 

We experimented different methods and made comparisons among them. 

We used end-to-end method based on CNN architecture, for which we experimented two different specific architectures. 

At the same time we also explored end-to-end method based on GAN. 

Furthermore, we used our recommendation system to recommend similar images for any given image, and retrained the GAN model using the recommended references.
